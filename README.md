# Football-Fever

<p> The name of the project that me and my partner have created is called Football Fever. This is a simple football game, where you have to score as many touchdowns you can in a certain amount of time. However, must watch out for the other playerrs which can lower your health. But do not worry you will be rewarded by collecting coins and gatorade bottles which both increase your score, or your health. Enjoy! <p>
